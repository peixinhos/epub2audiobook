Creating an Audiobook (mp3 file) using a Ebook (epub) using BeautifulSoup and Google Text to Speech

I wrote this in 2020. This is one of my first python projects.
I've made improvements on it, but it isn't my cleanest code.
Please be kind in the comments, I look forward to hearing some feedbacks :)
